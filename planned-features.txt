This is a list of the features that I plan on adding to this app. 
Here are the ones I am currently strongly considering:
1. I plan on allowing word definitions to be exported to flashcard decks
2. I plan on allowing promtps, models, and timeouts to be configurable (Done)
3. Adding follow ups to the grammar explanations to allow the user to explore specific points (Done)
4. A grammar book that will allow the user to add specific explanations of the grammar to a spot where they can be saved (done)
5. Batch processing for word explanations
6. Sort and filter options for words and phrases
7. I might look into tool use to allow agents to export words in the sentences directly to flash cards
7a. I might need some universal vocabulary tracker for that to work well.
7b. If I do that, it might also be a good idea to make sure the model doesn't add a bunch of excessively easy words
8. I might try to add quiz features
9. example sentence generation based on grammar patterns (after grammar book is added)
10. Perhaps I can even give the LLMs tool use and allow them to look up what one should know for specific exams for various languages could be
11. Ability to import and export flashcard decks
11a. Cross compatibility with Anki
12. Keyboard shortcuts
13. Visualizations of the statistics and progress
14. Images, Audio, and other media support for flashcards
15. UI localization if other people end up using it and it might be useful to publish
16. UI options such as dark mode
17. 

There are some longer-term ideas that I might look into. 
This is a list intended to just be a place to keep track of them and not necessarily ones that I would work on in the forseeable future.
- An option to use a custom dictionary that can look up words without relying on the LLM
- An option to use api-based LLMs
- Gamification features
- A much better UI that is built on something better than TKinter
- Exporting the grammar, sentences, and generated explanations to a file
- Cloud storage for everything. Possibly using a service like Google Drive
